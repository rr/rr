## 1.1.2 (August 17, 2013)

* Add tests, appraisals, etc. back to the published gem ([#32][i32]).
  This is necessary because Debian wraps rr in a package, and they depend on the
  tests to be present in order to run them prior to packaging.
* Add back RR::Adapters::RSpec2 which was removed accidentally ([#34][i34]).
  This fixes failures when running tests against sham_rack (which is no longer
  using RR, but, oh well).
* Remove deprecation warning about
  RSpec.configuration.backtrace_clean_patterns under RSpec 2.14 ([#37][i37]).
  NOTE: This warning will continue to appear if you are configuring RSpec using
  `mock_with :rr`. This is because the RR adapter bundled with RSpec still
  refers to `backtrace_clean_patterns` instead of
  `backtrace_exclusion_patterns`. You can either wait until the next release of
  rspec-core, or remove `mock_with :rr` (which is recommended at this point as
  we consider RSpec's adapter to be slightly out of date, and RR provides its
  own adapter for RSpec).
* RR now officially supports Rails 4.0.0. (It worked before, but now we're
  explicitly testing against it instead of 4.0.0.rc1.)
* Fix Test::Unit 1 and 2 adapters to avoid a possible "undefined
  Test::Unit::TestCase" error.
* Prevent adapters from being double-loaded.
* Including RR::Adapters::TestUnit, RR::Adapters::MiniTest, or
  RR::Adapters::RSpec2 now just re-runs the autohook mechanism instead of
  building a fake adapter, as it was possible to include both a real and fake
  adapter in the same space and they could conflict with each other.

## 1.1.1 (June 17, 2013)

* Fix incompatibility issues with Rails 4 ([#26][i26]) and Cucumber
  ([#29][i29]).
* Add missing adapter for Test::Unit 2.0.0 (version which is built into Ruby
  1.9/2.0). The tests for Jekyll were failing because of this ([#27][i27]).
* If an error occurs while checking to see whether an adapter applies or when
  loading the adapter itself, it is now swallowed so that the user can move on.

## 1.1.0 (May 20, 2013)

NOTE: RR development moved from [btakita/rr][btakita-rr] to [rr/rr][rr-rr].
Issues are re-numbered beginning from 1 from this point on.

* Fix a line in RR::Injections::DoubleInjection to use top-level RR constant
  ([#3][i3]) [[@Thibaut][Thibaut]]
* Fix all wildcard matches so they work within hashes and arrays. This means
  that `stub([hash_containing(:foo => 'bar')])` will match
  `stub([{:foo => 'bar', :baz => 'qux'}])`. ([#4][i4])
* RR now auto-hooks into whichever test framework you have loaded; there is no
  longer a need to `include RR::Adapters::Whatever` into your test framework. If
  you don't like the autohook and prefer the old way, simply use
  `require 'rr/without_autohook'` instead of `require 'rr'`. (There are now
  nine adapters; see [lib/rr/autohook.rb][autohook] for the full list.)
* Fix Test::Unit adapters to ensure that any additional teardown is completely
  run in the event that RR's verify step produces an error. This was causing
  weirdness when using Test::Unit alongside Rails. ([#2][i2])
* Add an explicit Test::Unit / ActiveSupport adapter. As ActiveSupport::TestCase
  introduces its own setup/teardown hooks, use these when autohooking in RR.
  ([#2][i2])
* Add support for Minitest 5
* Upon release, the tests are now packaged up and uploaded to S3. This is for
  Linux distros like Fedora who wrap gems in RPM packages. You can always find
  the latest tests at <http://s3.amazonaws.com/rubygem-rr/tests/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz>,
  where X.Y.Z represents a version. I have retroactively packaged the tests for
  1.0.4 and 1.0.5.

## 1.0.5 (March 28, 2013)

* Compatibility with RSpec-2. There are now two adapters for RSpec, one that
  works with RSpec-1 and a new one that works with RSpec-2. Currently, saying
  `RSpec.configure {|c| c.mock_with(:rr) }` still uses RSpec-1; to use the new
  one, you say `RSpec.configure {|c| c.mock_framework = RR::Adapters::RSpec2 }`.
  ([#66][xi66], [#68][xi68], [#80][xi80]) [[@njay][njay], [@james2m][james2m]]
* Fix MethodMissingInjection so that `[stub].flatten` works without throwing a
  NoMethodError (`undefined method `to_ary'`) error under Ruby 1.9 ([#44][xi44])
* Raise a MiniTest::Assertion error in the MiniTest adapter so that mock
  failures appear in the output as failures rather than uncaught exceptions
  ([#69][xi69]) [[@jayferd][jayferd]]
* Completely remove leftover #new_instance_of method, and also remove
  mention of #new_instance_of from the README
* Fix tests so they all work and pass again

## 1.0.4 (June 11, 2011)

* Fixed bug using workaround with leftover MethodMissingInjections

  another mock's yield block ([#42][xi42]) [[@libc][libc]]

## 1.0.1 (October 30, 2010)

  alias for any_instance_of.
* Compatible with Ruby 1.9.2

## 1.0.0 (August 23, 2010)

* Added any_instance_of (aliased by all_instances_of), which binds methods

* Fixed stack overflow caused by double include in Test::Unit adapter
  ([#16][xi16])
* Fixed warnings [[@brynary][brynary]]

## 0.10.4 (September 26, 2009)

* Handle lazily defined methods (where respond_to? returns true yet the method
  is not yet defined and the first call to method_missing defines the method).
  This pattern is used in ActiveRecord and ActionMailer.
* Fixed warning about aliasing #instance_exec in jruby.
  ([#9][xi9]) [[@nathansobo][nathansobo]]

## 0.10.2 (August 30, 2009)

* RR properly proxies subjects with private methods ([#7][xi7])

  ([#4][xi4])
